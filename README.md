## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Python 2.7. Should work fine with Python 3 but it has not been tested.
* AMUSE: https://github.com/amusecode/amuse
* vader: https://bitbucket.org/krumholz/vader/src
* scipy

### Running the simulations

You can run an individual simulation by using the AMUSE script directly:

```
amuse.sh vader_cluster_parallel.py
```

The script has extensive options which can be passed through the command line. For a list of these options run:

```
amuse.sh vader_cluster_parallel.py --help
```

### Creating the plots

All figures of the paper (except Figures 3 and 4, which are flow charts) were created using the script ``plots.py``:

```
amuse.sh plots.py
```
A list of options is available for this script, including the path to the files that you want to use for the plots. To see the list of options add ```--help``` or ```-h``` to the line above.

The tests and figures of the appendix can be created using the script ``tests.py``:

```
amuse.sh tests.py
```
